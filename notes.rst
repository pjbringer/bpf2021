BPF 2021
========

This project is an attempt to get up to speed to with BPF. I hope to write
some learning material and some code to showcase a possible use for BPF
as an interface to programming MCUs, allowing custom applications to be
written, without blowing up the complexity on the sensor/actuator side.

Status
------
