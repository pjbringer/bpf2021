Experiment 2
============

Make bpf program from bpf assembly. This program was lifted with only minor modification from the Linux documentation.

Status
------
The programs can be generated from bpf assembly.

Setup
-----
The bpf_asm command is used (see Makefile)

Result
------
The bpf code is assembled, but there is seemingly no header. This seems somewhat insufficient.
